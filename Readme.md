# TITLE

This is our final project for Java Deep Dive. We will create an application that 
scrapes www.valutakurser.dk for any relevant data to analyze and display it in a meaningful way.
This makes it possible for anyone interested to keep track of currency changes and exchange rates across several
different currencies.
